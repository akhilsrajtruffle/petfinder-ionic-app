She is good with other dogs and loves being patted. It is amazing how much love she has for people considering everything she has been through. You see Annie is a survivor of the horrific dog meat trade in Asia. Rescued from what had been a barbaric death she was taken to a shelter in northern Thailand which is home to 1200 other rescued dogs as well. It was there that her personality was apparent to the Soi Dog staff who every month travel to this northern shelter to assess and bring back a group of dogs to their main facility in Phuket. In Phuket they further assess the dogs, work with them and fully vet them which includes spaying, vaccinating, micro chipping and any other vetting necessary. Annie is now ready to begin her new life in a loving home in Canada. At under 40 pounds this sweet girl is a good fit for almost any household.

They need a loving home where they can be spoiled.   These 2 dogs are very friendly and are great off leash and listen well. Bricks was attacked at a puppy by another dog so he is not dog friendly.  They are presently at a business and they are no longer wanted. They do not have a proper set up for the year round  elements and need to be rehomed for the owner does not want to fix. \n\nThey are both spayed and neutered, and are great in the car.  They love each other and we will supply 5 months of dog food for these 2.  They will have to be housetrained  and need a yard to run and play.

As we were leaving we saw a dog laying on the sidewalk. We gave her some treats and Sharon decided to move them far away so she would not risk getting run over and the gas attendant told her the dog didnt' belong to anyone, it has been there for over 2 months and they need it out of there. There was a second dog, but it was run over and died :( After some intervention and negotiation with the doorman of Burger King, and the gas attendant, Sharon secured the dog and we promised to try to find its owner and if not then get her adopted out. If this is your dog, or you know the owner of this dog, please message us. She does have a name as it is on her tag, so if you know her, please message me her name and we will get her returned to you. If nobody claims her, she will be for adoption.

Since yesterday, this post reached almost 22k people but we have still not had a single request for an adoption application. :( \n\nFolks, Hope and Lidia have had very little adoption interest and are UDR's longest case. We need your help by sharing these two girls and finding them a forever home. We realize that finding a home for two dogs is harder than just one but this mother/daughter duo are very bonded and they don't want to be split apart. From an adoption standpoint, they are great company and entertainment for each other. They're the perfect size (45-50lbs) and very little trouble. \n\nLidia is a pointer/husky mix and is Hope's mom. Hope's father was a purebred Border Collie. They are both spayed and vaccinated. Lidia is 2.5 and Hope is 1.5 years old. They have been raised with children. Both are housetrained and crate trained and are very intelligent dogs. They are used to country-living and so they need some work on leash manners. A Halti, patience, and consistent one-on-one walks will do them wonders. They live with two cats but do like to chase cats. A home with a fully fenced yard for them to relax in would be great. They love the outdoors. They would prefer to be the only dogs in the home as this is what they've always known and they have had little exposure to other dogs. Two is lots of dog anyway! :) \n\nPlease message us if you can offer these two lovely dogs a forever home.

The shelter changed their mind when the medical personnel commented on how sweet and gentle she was.   She was minimally treated for non-contagious demodex mange and has received further treatment since leaving the shelter,  She now has a clean bill of health, and although her hair has not fully grown back she is ready for her new and forever home.  Daisy is estimated to be about 10 - 11 months old, is a high energy pup and could do well living with another calm  but playful dog, as her exuberance is not always welcome.  She is in a foster home with a young puppy and another young male and they play endlessly and then Daisy calms down for cuddling with her family.  She is crate trained, good with children (she loves them but she could knock a young child over), sweet and gentle, microchipped, housebroken, and walks quite well on a front clasping harness. The 4 year old in her foster home loves to lie on the floor and let Daisy lick her and Daisy is happy to oblige.  She would need obedience classes as she has not had much training.  She knows basic commands.  A fenced back yard is a must for Daisy as her recall is not great yet, but she has only been out of the shelter and in an actual home for less than 2 weeks now.  Her microchip is registered to the Miami-Dade shelter so her owner would have to re-register the chip with a Canadian company.  Because Daisy was a stray we are guessing at her breed mix but she seems to be predominantly lab.  She is amazing and so loving with people.
