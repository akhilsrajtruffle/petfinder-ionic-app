George somehow ended up in a shelter in Thailand with 5000 other dogs from which he was rescued. Who knows the hardships and horrors he's experienced so far in his life. And though he has experienced so much he is still a sweet gentle soul. George is good with other dogs but not with dogs who are going to bully him or be too in his face. As well George is a little older at about 8 years of age so we will not be charging our normal adoption fee. A donation to the organization in Thailand though would be appreciated. George is neutered and up to date on all vaccinations. We hope to find a caring, loving home that this sweet boy is so deserving of. Its been a long hard journey for George but with your help his journey can have a happy ending. For information on adopting George email us at firefighterdogrescue@gmail.com"

            "$t": "Toby\nMale/Neutered/$425\nBreed Guess: Hound mix\nAge: 1 year\nWeight: 14.5kg\n\nToby is a joy! Since coming to Canada, he has learned sit and down:  he is very smart dog and loves to learn. He does have energy at times, but he knows when its time to settle down and cuddle (foster mom appreciates his manners!). He is doing very well with house training, and he is crate trained. He has a great personality and he's soft as a teddy bear.  Toby is a fun loving guy that will make a great family member.\n\nWe are so proud of him as his rescue story was sad.  Toby was found wandering in a stadium and a man was trying to scare him away with a broom. Toby was on his back being submissive before a wonderful lady stopped the man from hurting him. Lucky for Toby, he entered a rescue and soon came to Canada. Toby is a super happy, playful guy that loves people, likes other dogs and cats.\n\nFor more information, please email foster mom whitepaws@rogers.com or fill an application on our web site www.dibsrescue.com"

She's a little excited by car rides and it's a good idea to buckle her in. Who can blame her? The car takes you to fun places! \n\nSimcoe is a 7 year old, energetic, fun, happy, playful dog looking for a forever home. She loves to walk, loves people and loves to play. Simcoe does enjoy playing large, calm dogs, but she can be overwhelming for small dogs. She just doesn't know her own size! We will require a home where Simcoe is the only dog. While she will play outside, she doesn't like to have doggy friends in her home. \n\nIf you would like to meet Simcoe, please email us to start the conversation. Please note that Simcoe is being fostered in the Bowmanville area and you must be able to travel there to meet her. We require that you complete an adoption application prior to meeting any of our dogs. An adoption fee will apply at time of adoption."

Brady is very affectionate and loving with the people he knows but sometimes can be a little shy and overwhelmed in an unknown environment.  His ideal home would be one where he will get lots of attention and love.  He'll give it back in spades!  \n\nHe's being fostered with another greyhound at the moment but he would be totally fine being an only dog.  His foster Mom and brother are bringing out his playful spirit and his confidence is building every day.\n\nIf you would like more information on Brady or would like to meet him, please contact adoption@afterthetrack.ca"

Since yesterday, this post reached almost 22k people but we have still not had a single request for an adoption application. :( \n\nFolks, Hope and Lidia have had very little adoption interest and are UDR's longest case. We need your help by sharing these two girls and finding them a forever home. We realize that finding a home for two dogs is harder than just one but this mother/daughter duo are very bonded and they don't want to be split apart. From an adoption standpoint, they are great company and entertainment for each other. They're the perfect size (45-50lbs) and very little trouble. \n\nLidia is a pointer/husky mix and is Hope's mom. Hope's father was a purebred Border Collie. They are both spayed and vaccinated. Lidia is 2.5 and Hope is 1.5 years old. They have been raised with children. Both are housetrained and crate trained and are very intelligent dogs. They are used to country-living and so they need some work on leash manners. A Halti, patience, and consistent one-on-one walks will do them wonders. They live with two cats but do like to chase cats. A home with a fully fenced yard for them to relax in would be great. They love the outdoors. They would prefer to be the only dogs in the home as this is what they've always known and they have had little exposure to other dogs. Two is lots of dog anyway! :) \n\nPlease message us if you can offer these two lovely dogs a forever home. They're located in Guelph, ON."

They are arriving in February and we are looking for foster to adopt homes for their arrival. They can all be adopted to separate homes. Tiki and Timon have boundless energy and would do great with an active family or couple or single person. A fenced in yard or lots of time in a dog park and walks would be wonderful.

He weighs about 50 pounds. Teddy loves to run and play.  We are looking for a family with another high energy dog or an active runner, walker or hiker who can give him regular exercise. He was surrendered because his owner didn't have time to spend with him. He is looking to bond with someone and would do great with an active single person or couple. Because of his energy level, youth and lots of changes for him we are looking for someone with dog experience, calm environment, commitment, stability and patience. Teddy's boundless enthusiasm and capacity for love will bring so much joy to the right home. Please contact our rescue as soon as possible to meet him by emailing C4PToronto@gmail.com."

He was surrendered because he has a heart condition and the family had a very active household. Jonas can go for walks but should not have strenuous exercise. A home with no other pets, or perhaps another calm, older dog and older children would be best.  Jonas needs someone to love and care for him. He is so deserving and right now is in a kennel. He needs a home as soon as possible.  A single person or couple with a quiet home and love to give would be wonderful too. Please contact our rescue as soon as possible to meet him by emailing C4PToronto@gmail.com."

Why? Nobody can imagine why a person would do such a thing.. Vivi is a very healthy dog.  Spayed and up to date on all shots. She loves food a lot.  By now she knows all the dogs and people in the house so she does not hide anymore and she loves to cuddles.  She deserves a nice life.  In the foster home with so many dogs and with many new dogs all the time, she needs to get used to new smells all the time. She is very brave for a young two year old dog. We are looking for that special home and will waive our adoption fee to help with additional costs. We have an excellent  trainer who will work with a family to help her adjust. Blind dogs usually become so good at compensating it's sometimes hard to tell they are blind.  She is up to date on shots and spayed. She gets along with the other dogs and would be good with respectful children. Please contact our rescue Cause 4 Paws Toronto at C4PToronto@gmail.com for more information about her and our foster to adopt program."

Likes to bark so not suitable for an apartment.\nGood with Dogs: Yes\nGood with Cats: No, will chase cat\nGood with Kids: Older, respectful children (11 and older)\nNeeds another Dog: Nice but not necessary: Needs to be an only Dog: Fine either way\nHousetraining: Work in progress; good but not perfect\nSuitable for an Apartment: No, if left alone Theo will bark and howl.\nOrigin: Owner surrender\nAdoption Fee? 400.00\n\n \n\nAnd now a few words from me:\n\nHi there, I'm Theo the Doxie-Pin (Dachshund x Miniature Pinscher). Iâm a 12 lb bundle of energy who loves cuddling. I especially like napping on the big bed with my foster mom.  I will snuggle right in and get under the covers if she lets me.  I can jump very high and getting onto the bed and couch is easy for me. Iâm good with my canine foster siblings, but would rather chase the family cat than be his friend, so a home without a cat might be best!  I love, love, love my toys.  If they squeak, I am quick to remove the squeaker!  I am a very nice guy that occasionally needs some time to warm up to people.  I will bark at strangers -- they might be dangerous you know!  If you are looking for a handsome guy with lots of âget-up-and-goâ and who also enjoys snuggling and watching movies, then Iâm your guy.\n\n \n\n\nAnd now a few words from my foster family:\n\nTheo is a happy little guy who is super cuddly and a joy to have around.  He loves his people and wants nothing more than to be right next to you all the time. Theo can run like the wind and whips around the house and yard with no problem.  When not in a fenced yard, he must be on a leash.  For the most part he does his potty outside, but in the colder weather he will need a coat.  Theo has a healthy bark that he is not afraid to use. He has a good recall and knows what \"no\" means. He is fine with other small to medium size dogs but will chase the house cat if given the chance.  He has a high prey drive. He likes his car rides and would prefer to sit with you rather than ride in the back seat.  Theo is still young, so needs patience and training to help him become the best dog he can be. He will be a wonderful companion in his forever family."

Needs a confident owner who will give him rules and boundaries.\nGood with Dogs: Big dogs possible; NO small dogs.\nGood with Cats: NO; high prey drive and cannot be with cats or rodents\nGood with Kids: Yes to 12 years and older\nNeeds another Dog: NO.

I have already had two homes in my lifetime; the last one loved me but I did not like the visiting children. I am true to my breed and breeding. You see I am a Double Dapple, which gives me some unique qualities, such as my colouring.  I am handsome and very distinguished looking.  But being a Double Dapple can also mean visual and hearing impairments.  In my case, my vision isnât perfect but my hearing has not been affected.  I love humans more than other animals. This is where I am true to my breed â I am a hunter.  I love to hunt for squirrels, chipmunks and birds etc., and my prey drive extends to cats as well (and I donât mean just to chase them).  I also do not tolerate young or small dogs.  For these reasons, I am best as an only dog.  My favourite pastime, other than being an outdoorsman, is to cuddle and be with my human.  So if you have a spot for me to be your one and only fur family member, Iâm your guy!\n \nAnd now a few words from my foster family:\nPetey is a great character, but he really needs to be an only pet in the house. His prey drive towards wildlife is high, and while on walks he is always on guard for squirrels and chipmunks lurking about.  Petey does not tolerate cats at all.  While he has learned to be around other dogs, small dogs and young dogs are not his thing.  He should not be spending time at dog parks.  His ideal home would include the following:  a low level of activity (due to his visual impairment he is not always sure what is happening around him); no other pets; and dog-savvy kids that are 12 years and older.  A retired human(s) or someone single that is looking for a great solo companion would be the ideal home situation for Petey."
